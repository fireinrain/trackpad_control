# Trackpad Control

Trackpad Control is a macOS menu bar app that turns custom multi-finger trackpad gestures into actions like app launch, keyboard shortcuts, and window management.

It is built for power users who want gesture automation on Mac without opening full automation tools.

## Download

[**→ Download trackpad_control.zip from the latest release**](https://github.com/Smoep/trackpad_control/releases/latest)

Unzip and drag **trackpad_control.app** to your Applications folder. New installs
from the prebuilt release start with a library of 51 recorded gestures, so you can
enable, adapt, or delete examples instead of recording everything from scratch.

The release also includes `starter-gestures.json` as a separate download. Import
it from **Settings → Advanced → Import…** if you already ran an older version or
want to restore the starter library. Importing replaces the current gesture list,
so export your existing gestures first if you want to keep them.

> **First launch:** macOS will show a security warning because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
> Right-click (or Control-click) the app → **Open** → **Open**. You only need to do this once.

## What It Does

- Records one to five finger gestures on the Mac trackpad
- Matches gestures with a shape-based recognizer tuned for noisy real-world input
- Triggers actions: launch apps, run shortcuts, execute continuous actions, and control windows
- Runs from the menu bar with configurable settings and optional overlay diagnostics

## Build & install

Building requires Xcode 26 or newer. The built app supports **macOS 12 (Monterey) through macOS 26**.
